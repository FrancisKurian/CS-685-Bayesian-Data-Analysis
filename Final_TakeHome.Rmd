#### **Problem 1**

A multiple regression model is being built to predict the survival time in days 
($Y$) using a set of 4 candidate predictors:

* $X_1$ = blood-clotting index
* $X_2$ = prognostic measurement
* $X_3$ = enzyme measurement
* $X_4$ = liver function measurement

You are given the following data, which I have converted to a data frame for you:

```{r survdata}
x1 = c(6.7, 5.1, 7.4, 6.5, 7.8, 5.8, 5.7, 3.7, 6, 3.7, 6.3, 6.7, 5.8, 5.8, 7.7,
       7.4, 6, 3.7, 7.3, 5.6, 5.2, 3.4, 6.7, 5.8, 6.3, 5.8, 5.2, 11.2, 5.2, 5.8,
       3.2, 8.7, 5, 5.8, 5.4, 5.3, 2.6, 4.3, 4.8, 5.4, 5.2, 3.6, 8.8, 6.5, 3.4,
       6.5, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 3.9, 6.6, 6.4, 6.4, 8.8)

x2 = c(62, 59, 57, 73, 65, 38, 46, 68, 67, 76, 84, 51, 96, 83, 62, 74, 85, 51,
       68, 57, 52, 83, 26, 67, 59, 61, 52, 76, 54, 76, 64, 45, 59, 72, 58, 51,
       74, 8, 61, 52, 49, 28, 86, 56, 77, 40, 73, 86, 67, 82, 77, 85, 59, 78)
  
x3 = c(81, 66, 83, 41, 115, 72, 63, 81, 93, 94, 83, 43, 114, 88, 67, 68, 28, 41,
       74, 87, 76, 53, 68, 86, 100, 73, 86, 90, 56, 59, 65, 23, 73, 93, 70, 99,
       86, 119, 76, 88, 72, 99, 88, 77, 93, 84, 106, 101, 77, 103, 46, 40, 85,
       72)
  
x4 = c(2.59, 1.7, 2.16, 2.01, 4.3, 1.42, 1.91, 2.57, 2.5, 2.4, 4.13, 1.86, 3.95,
       3.95, 3.4, 2.4, 2.98, 1.55, 3.56, 3.02, 2.85, 1.12, 2.1, 3.4, 2.95, 3.5,
       2.45, 5.59, 2.71, 2.58, 0.74, 2.52, 3.5, 3.3, 2.64, 2.6, 2.05, 2.85,
       2.45, 1.81, 1.84, 1.3, 6.4, 2.85, 1.48, 3, 3.05, 4.1, 2.86, 4.55, 1.95,
       1.21, 2.33, 3.2)

y = c(200, 101, 204, 101, 509, 80, 80, 127, 202, 203, 329, 65, 830, 330, 168, 
      217, 87, 34, 215, 172, 109, 136, 70, 220, 276, 144, 181, 574, 72, 178, 71,
      58, 116, 295, 115, 184, 118, 120, 151, 148, 95, 75, 483, 153, 191, 123,
      311, 398, 158, 310, 124, 125, 198, 313)

df = data.frame(x1=x1,x2=x2,x3=x3,x4=x4,y=y)
```

#### **1a.)**
Your supervisor insists that you log transform the dependent variable $Y$. Why
might this be? Perform this operation and use the log-transformed DV for all 
subsequent calculations.

#### **Answer 1a.)**
```{r 1a_skewness}
cat("Skewness of df$y =", skewness(df$y), "| Skewness of log(df$y) =", skewness(log(df$y)), "\n")
```
Skewness of variable y = 2.1, positively skewed and unfit for linear regression.
Skewness of log(y)= 0.22, more symmetric distribution,residuals/errors are more likely to be normally distributed. 
So the supervisor is insisting this to ensure the assumption of  homoscedasticityâ€”constant variance of errors

------

#### **1b.)**
Assuming $\log(Y)\sim Normal(\mu,\sigma)$ with 
$\mu = \beta_0+\beta_1X_1+\beta_2X_2+\beta_3X_3+\beta_4X_4$,
use the `rstanarm` package to sample values from the posterior distribution.
Use weakly informative priors, four chains with 10,000 iterations each (with
the first half as a burn in) and  random seed `12345`.

#### **Answer 1b.)**
Please see the model specification and simulation results below:

```{r 1b_model, echo = TRUE, results = "hide", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

centered_intercept=mean(log(df$y))
model_survival <- stan_glm(
  formula = log(y) ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x4,
  data = df,
  family = gaussian(),
  prior_intercept = normal(centered_intercept, 5),
  prior = normal(0, 10,autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_aux = exponential(0.6,autoscale = TRUE),
  chains = 4,
  iter = 5000*2,
  warmup = 5000,
  seed = 12345
)


neff_ratio(model_survival)
rhat(model_survival)
mcmc_trace(model_survival)
mcmc_dens_overlay(model_survival)

```                                                                                                                        
------

#### **1c.)**
Give point estimates and 95% credible intervals for all parameters (including 
$\sigma$). Which variables, if any, appear to be unimportant in predicting
survival time?

#### **Answer 1c.)**

```{r 1c_confidence }
tidy(model_survival, effects  = c('fixed','aux'),conf.int = T, conf.level = 0.95)
```
Results suggest x4 does not have a statistically significant effect on predicting survival time in this model, as the credible interval includes 0 probability.
------

#### **1d.)**
Give a point estimate and a 95% credible interval for the expected survival time (**in days**) for a patient with blood-clotting index 6.0, prognostic 
measurement 65, enzyme measurement 72.00, and liver function measurement 1.50.

#### **Answer 1d.)**
Point estimate for given data points is below:

```{r 1d_pointEstimate }

new_data <- tibble::tibble(  x1 = 6.0,    x2 = 65,    x3 = 72,     x4 = 1.50  )

# incorporate mean and variance from the simulation for the point estimate

posterior_predictions <- posterior_predict(
  model_survival,      
  newdata = new_data
)

# Compute point estimate and credible interval
point_estimate <- mean(posterior_predictions)
credible_interval <- quantile(posterior_predictions, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))

# Conver log Y into original scale using exponents
tibble::tibble(
  `Point Estimate (days)` = exp(point_estimate),
  `Lower 95% CI (days)` = exp(credible_interval[1]),
  `Upper 95% CI (days)` = exp(credible_interval[2])
)
```

------

#### **1e.)**
Without running another regression model, give a point estimate for the ratio of
expected survival time (in days) for patients with blood clotting index 7.0 
compared  to patients with blood clotting index 6.0
(holding other predictors constant). Explain how you got your answer.

#### **Answer 1e.)**

x1 changing one unit will result in: 
$$
e^{\beta_1} = e^{0.158} \approx 1.171
$$
The expected survival time for a patient with a blood clotting index of 7.0 is  1.171 times (17.1%) longer than a patient with a blood clotting index of 6.0, holding all other predictors constant.


------

#### **1f.)**
With four predictors, there are a total of 15 possible regression models (4 with
1 IV, 6 with 2 IVs, 4 with 3 IVs, and 1 with  4 IVs). Estimate the posterior 
for each of these outcomes and calcuate the expected log-predictive density for
each model. Then use the `loo_compare` function to compare these results. What
model would you select and why?

```{r 1f_nmodels,echo = TRUE, results = "hide", message = FALSE,warning = FALSE}

# Define the outcome variable and predictors
outcome <- "log(y)"  # Change as per your dataset
predictors <- c("x1", "x2", "x3", "x4")

# Generate all possible combinations of predictors
model_formulas <- unlist(lapply(1:length(predictors), function(k) {
  combn(predictors, k, FUN = function(x) paste(outcome, "~", paste(x, collapse = " + ")))
}))

# Fit models for each formula and store them
models <- lapply(model_formulas, function(formula) {
  stan_glm(
    formula = as.formula(formula),
    data = df,
    family = gaussian(),
    prior_intercept = normal(centered_intercept, 5),
    prior = normal(0, 10, autoscale = TRUE),
    prior_aux = exponential(0.6, autoscale = TRUE),
    chains = 4,
    iter = 5000*2,
    seed = 123456
  )
})


# Compute LOO for all models
loo_results <- lapply(models, loo)
loo_compare(loo_results)


# Extract the best model
best_model_index <- which.max(sapply(loo_results, function(x) x$estimates["elpd_loo", "Estimate"]))
best_model <- models[[best_model_index]]
# Print summary of the best model
summary(best_model)

elpd_df <- data.frame(Model_Index = integer(),ELPD = numeric(), SE = numeric(), elpd_diff = numeric(),se_diff = numeric())
# Loop through each model and compute ELPD
for (i in seq_along(models)) {
  model_elpd <- loo(models[[i]])  # Compute LOO for the model
  elpd_df <- rbind(elpd_df, data.frame(
    Model_Index = i,
    ELPD = model_elpd$estimates["elpd_loo", "Estimate"],
    SE = model_elpd$estimates["elpd_loo", "SE"]
  ))
}
# Print the results
print(elpd_df)


```
```{r 1f_nmodels1, message = FALSE,warning = FALSE}
loo_compare(loo_results)
summary(best_model)
```
```{r 1f_nmodels2,message = FALSE,warning = FALSE}
print(elpd_df)
```

#### **Answer 1f.)**

From the results above, model #11 is the best as it has the highest ELPD of 38.7. best model exclude variable X4.  loo_compare picks the highest 
ELPD model and use it as baseline to compare with other models. Somehow function results clearly dont identify the model so I did additional 
steps to list the model specification and original ELPD and SE scores.

------

#### **Problem 2**
In our very first example in class, we used the `fake_news` data set from the
`bayesrules` package, which contains information about 150 news articles, to
assess the probability that a news story was real or fake news. In this exercise,
we will expand this approach by building a logistic regression model with `type`,
(i.e. fake vs. real) as the DV and the following IVs:

* `title_has_excl`: title includes an exclamation point ,
* `title_words`: the number of words in the title
* `negative`: negative sentiment rating. 
* `title_caps_percent`: % of title words capitalized 
* `text_caps_percent`: % of text words capitalized 

------

#### **2a.)**
Use the `rstanarm` package to sample values from the posterior distribution.
You shoud use weakly informative priors, four chains with 10,000 iterations each
(withthe first half as a burn in) and  random seed `12345`.
```{r 2a_model,echo = TRUE, results = "hide", message = FALSE,warning = FALSE}
fake_news_df <- data.frame(
  type = fake_news$type,
  title_has_excl = fake_news$title_has_excl,
  title_words = fake_news$title_words,
  negative = fake_news$negative,
  title_caps_percent = fake_news$title_caps_percent,
  text_caps_percent = fake_news$text_caps_percent
)

model_fake_news <- stan_glm(
  formula = type ~ title_has_excl + title_words + negative + title_caps_percent + text_caps_percent,
  data = fake_news,
  family = binomial(link = "logit"), 
  prior_intercept = normal(0, 10),     
  prior = normal(0, 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
  chains = 4,                        
  iter = 5000*2,                     
  warmup = 5000,                     
  seed = 12345                      
)

prior_summary(model_fake_news)
neff_ratio(model_fake_news)
rhat(model_fake_news)
mcmc_trace(model_fake_news)
mcmc_dens_overlay(model_fake_news)

```
#### **Answer 2a.)**
Table below summarizes the parameter estimates:

```{r 2a_model2, message = FALSE,warning = FALSE}
tidy(model_fake_news, effects  = c('fixed','aux'),
     conf.int = T, conf.level = 0.90)
```
------

#### **2b.)**
Which predictors appear to have a significant impact on fake vs. real
news at the 90% confidence level.


#### **Answer 2b.)**
'title_has_exclTRUE' and 'negative' are the predictors with significant impact at 90% confidence interval. Intercept is also significant. 
------

#### **2c.)**
Present and interpret a confusion matrix and classification evaluation metrics
(accuracy, sensitivity, specificity) for predictions made for each observation 
in the data set. Repeat with a 10-fold cross-validation and compare the results.

```{r 2c_model, message = FALSE,warning = FALSE}
set.seed(84735)
classification_summary(model = model_fake_news, data = fake_news_df, cutoff = 0.5)

classification_summary_cv(model=model_fake_news,data=fake_news_df,cutoff = 0.5,k=10)

```

#### **Answer 2c.)**
Sensitivity or True Positive rate =76/90 =84%.  True Negative rate or specificity =45% 
Overall accuracy is at 68.7%.  Cut off used is 0.5 so this means, a probability of 0.5 or above
are classified as real and rest are classified as fake.

So the model is good at identifying the real articles at 84% however, it struggles in classifying
fake news.

Since we are interested in fake news classification, we need to look at specificity even at the expense of 

Cross Validation slightly regularized the predictions. Specificity and overall accuracy are slightly lower. 

------

#### **2d.)**
How do the results change if you change the classification threshold from 0.5 to
0.8? Create a ROC curve and identify the optimal classification threshold. Also 
provide and interpret the AUC. 

```{r 2d_model, message = FALSE,warning = FALSE}

set.seed(84735)
classification_summary(model = model_fake_news, data = fake_news_df, cutoff = 0.8)
predictions <- posterior_predict(model_fake_news, newdata = fake_news_df)
pred_mean <- colMeans(predictions)

# Create ROC object
roc_obj <- roc(fake_news_df$type, pred_mean)
pROC::auc(roc_obj)  
# Plot ROC curve
plot(roc_obj, main = "ROC Curve for Bayesian Fake News Model", 
     col = "blue", lwd = 2)
abline(a = 0, b = 1, lty = 2, col = "gray")
coords(roc_obj, "best", best.method = "youden")

```

#### **Answer 2d.)**
Specificity has significantly improved from 45% (at 0.5 cutoff) to 95% (at 0.8 cutoff).But with a  
compromise on overall accuracy.

AUC is 0.767 or 77% area covered under the curve. Which shows an acceptable separation from fake vs real.  

Optimal classification threshold is 0.71 and that's where we achieve 87% specificity. Sensitivity will be 0.58%
As we can see in the ROC graph, this is the part curve is close to Y axis and steep.  

Look at the ROC curve and identify the point closest to the top-left corner. 
This point represents the best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. our objectives and cost tolerance 
normally drives the cut-off decision.

------

#### **Problem 3**
In this problem, you will build a regression model for an insurance company to 
relate the claim amount for an automobile accident (`Y` , in thousands of dollars)
to the age of the damaged vehicle (`X`, in years). An insurance adjuster tells you
that  for a specific value of vehicle age `X`, the claim amount follows a Gamma
distribution with shape hyperparameter $s = e^{\beta_0+\frac{\beta_1}{\sqrt x}}$
and rate hyperparameter $r=1$. You are also provided with the following data set

```{r 3a_model,echo = TRUE, results = "hide", message = FALSE,warning = FALSE}
age_veh <- c(2.07,4.28,2.43,4.24,1.52,7.48,1.55,4.95,12.22,0.68,

             12.14,4.18,3.93,5.39,7.03,3.42,7.63,8.56,1.57,8.74)

claim_amt <- c(32.158,17.333,24.626,34.212,27.237,22.989,29.699,

               28.522,18.877,21.419,22.244,20.068,21.061,29.754,
               20.512)

# Data list for Stan
claim_data <- list(
  N = length(age_veh),
  x = age_veh,
  y = claim_amt
)


claim_model <- "
data {
  int<lower=0> N;
  vector[N] x;
  vector[N] y;
}

  for (n in 1:N) {
    shape_param[n] = exp(beta_0 + beta_1 / sqrt(x[n]));
  }

  y ~ gamma(shape_param, 1);
}
"

# Fit the model using rstan
claim_sim <- stan(model_code = claim_model, data = claim_data,
            chains = 4, iter = 4000, warmup = 2000, seed = 12345)
```

------

#### **3a.)** 
Use STAN to sample values from the posterior distribution. The priors for both 
$\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ should be normal distributions with mean 0 and standard 
deviation 100. Use four chains with 4,000 iterations each with the first 
half as a burn in and use random seed `12345`.

This is a more complex model than can be handled with the pre-compiled functions
in `rstanarm`. Therefore, you must use native `stan` code in the `rstan` package.
(See Section 9.3.2 in your text for an example for a simpler problem). Also, the
time for the model to compile (before sampling the posterior via MCMC) was a
was a bit longer than what we've seen in class. So I found it efficient to compile
first using the `stan_model` function and then to sample the posterior using the
`sampling` function - but the old way as shown in Section 9.3.2 will work if you
don't want to do this. 

#### **Answer 3a.)**
The code is building a regression model for an insurance claim amount that depends on a predictor (x, the age of the vehicle). The outcome Y is assumed to be drawn from a Gamma distribution whose shape parameter depends on x through a nonlinear transformation. This adds a layer of complexity.A Gamma likelihood with a shape parameter thatâ€™s a nonlinear function of the predictors. also two unknown regression parameters (beta_0 and beta_1).

```{r 3a_model2, message = FALSE,warning = FALSE}
mcmc_trace(claim_sim, pars = c("beta_0","beta_1"))
mcmc_hist(claim_sim, pars = c("beta_0","beta_1"))
mcmc_dens(claim_sim, pars = c("beta_0","beta_1"))

```
------

#### **3b.)**
Give point estimates and a 90% credible interval for both $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$.

#### **Answer 3b.)**

Give point estimates and Credible intervals for both $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$

```{r 3b_model, message = FALSE,warning = FALSE}
tidy(claim_sim , effects  = c('fixed','aux'),
     conf.int = T, conf.level = 0.90)
```

------

#### **3c.)**
Plot an estimate of the expected value of $Y$ as a function of $X$ for 
$X = {0.5, 1,1.5, ..., 15}$. Use random seed `12345` and be sure your 
calculation of the expected value accounts for both the posterior and sampling
variability. What does this estimated model imply about the relationship between
the claim amount and the age of the vehicle?
```{r 3c_model, message = FALSE,warning = FALSE}

parameters <- rstan::extract(claim_sim)
set.seed(12345)
X_values <- seq(0.5, 15, by = 0.5)

# E[Y|X] = s = exp(beta_0 + beta_1 / sqrt(X))
expected_values <- sapply(X_values, function(xi) {
  exp(parameters$beta_0 + parameters$beta_1 / sqrt(xi))
})

summary_stats <- t(apply(expected_values, 2, function(vals) {
  c(mean = mean(vals),
    lower = quantile(vals, 0.025),
    upper = quantile(vals, 0.975))
}))

colnames(summary_stats) <- c("mean", "lower", "upper")
plot_data <- data.frame(X = X_values,
                        mean = summary_stats[, "mean"],
                        lower = summary_stats[, "lower"],
                        upper = summary_stats[, "upper"])

```

#### **Answer 3c.)**

```{r 3c_model2, message = FALSE,warning = FALSE}

#### **3d.)**
Use your work in the previous section to estimate the expected claim amount for
a damaged vehicle that is 10.5 years old.

#### **Answer 3d.)**

```{r 3d_model, message = FALSE,warning = FALSE}

beta_0 <- parameters$beta_0
beta_1 <- parameters$beta_1

new_x <- 10.5
new_expected_values <- exp(beta_0 + beta_1 / sqrt(new_x))
mean_estimate <- mean(new_expected_values)
ci <- quantile(new_expected_values, c(0.025, 0.975))

mean_estimate
ci

```

For a damaged vehicle that is 10.5 years old, expected claim amount is $ 19,906.24.
